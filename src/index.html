	        <p class="lead refugee-text">A deeply touching photograph of a little girl went around the world a few days ago. A little girl in a Syrian refugee camp who has her arms stretched up in the air, surrendering to the camera which she had mistaken for a gun. We have all heard a lot about the drama of Syrian refugees, but what was so shocking about this photo was that her big round eyes looked directly at us, demanding we do not look away. Given the chance, most of us would have done anything possible to take her away from that situation. But the story is much closer to us than we realize. Cyprus has been receiving Syrian refugees in modest numbers and amongst them there are cases of fathers or mothers who had to flee the war, unable to take their children with them, hoping to be reunited with them once they reached a safe heaven.</p>
